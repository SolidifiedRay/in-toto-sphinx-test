# in-toto governance
This document covers the project's governance and committer process.  The
project consists of the in-toto

[reference implementation](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto).

## Maintainership and Consensus Builder
The project is maintained by the people indicated in
[MAINTAINERS.txt](MAINTAINERS.txt).  A maintainer is expected to (1) submit and
review GitHub pull requests and (2) open issues or [submit vulnerability
reports](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto#security-issues-and-bugs).
A maintainer has the authority to approve or reject pull requests submitted by
contributors.  The project's Consensus Builder (CB) is
Justin Cappos <jcappos@nyu.edu, @JustinCappos>.

conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md), the [Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) and the [code style
guidelines](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/code-style-guidelines), and
they must unit test any new software feature or change.  Submitted pull
requests undergo review and automated testing, including, but not limited to:

* Unit and build testing via [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/in-toto/in-toto) and
